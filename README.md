This project demonstrates a step-by-step implementation of a **Serverless HTTP API**
using **AWS Lambda** and **Amazon API Gateway**.
Each step includes clear explanations and screenshots for better understanding.

## Step 1: Login to AWS Console

- Logged into the **AWS Management Console** using an **IAM user** account.
- After successful login, the **AWS Console Home** page is displayed.
- The region is set to **US East (N. Virginia)**, which will be used for creating AWS resources in this project.
- From the Console Home, AWS services such as **EC2, S3, RDS, and Lambda** can be accessed using the search bar or service links.

## Step 2: Search for AWS Lambda Service

- Used the **search bar** at the top of the AWS Management Console.
- Typed **“Lambda”** to find the AWS Lambda service.
- AWS displays Lambda under the **Services** section with the description *“Run code without thinking about servers”*.
- This step is required to navigate to the Lambda service, where serverless functions will be created.
